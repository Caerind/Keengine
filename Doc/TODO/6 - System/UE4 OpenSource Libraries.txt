ADO : This just sets up an include path to a set of libs included by windows for database acccess
ANGLE : Replicates the graphics feature set provided by many mobile devices ( including HTML ) on windows
Android/cxa_demangle : We need callstack printing when running on Android devices and we need this function to convert a mangled function name into a human-readable one.  We link with cxx-stl from stlport, but that doesn’t include the abi::__cxa_demangle function in the library. The gnu-libstdc++ libraries also included with the NDK do include this function, but we don’t link against gnu-libstdc++ and I don’t want to do so just for this function. The easiest solution is to compile the __cxa_demangle source code file and link it manually.
